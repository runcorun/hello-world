All the things
Hi, I'm runcorun. I like peanut butter sandwiches and cheese!
I'm going to fill you up with coding skills from html, css, php, swift, ruby and java!

Two months later, I've returned here to learn more about Github. I now understand what a 'commit' is. 

20190222 Gee, when were those all written? Oh well. 
I'm here writing about how I'm attempting to transfer my work from Codepen.io. This will allow me 
to create picture files on GitHub, which I can use in my portfolio.
Also, on freeCodeCamp, I finished HTML and CSS, and I'm half way through JavaScript (hooray!). 

Ok, knowing how to use GitHub isn't coming as easily as I thought it would. And adding my work
from Codepen.io isn't coming off as very easy.
